<h1 align="center">Log Analytics Workspace & Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) Setup</h1>

<br>


![Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc4caf7-8f6c-4747-aaeb-eeee80212ba0)
<br />
<br />

In this lab we'll set up **Log Analytics Workspace** as our **Central Log Repository****, as well as **Microsoft Sentinel** as our **SIEM**.

Basically we're going to create what we call a **"Watchlist"** inside of our **SIEM** (Microsoft Sentinel).

This Watchlist is going to essentially be a big long list of **Network Blocks**, with the corresponding *Longitude*, *Latitude*, *City Name* and *Country Name*.

And basically we'll use this to derive **Geo-location from Attacker's IP Addresses**.

So when somebody **Attacks our Network**, or for example they fail to login to our Virtual Machine, we'll be able to:
1. Inspect that Log
2. Match the Log to a given Network Block
3. and Plot it on the World Map

This way we'll be able to clearly see **Where the Attacks are Coming From**, according to their **Geo-Location**.

<br>

The first thing we're going to do is **[Download this Geo-Data CSV file](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/blob/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON)/geoip-summarized.csv 
)** onto our Desktop.

It will open up a new tab, and you can **Download the Raw File**:

> 
> This will be our **Centralized Repository** for **Collecting, Storing & Analyzing Log Data** from various **Azure Resources and Services**.

<br>

We'll go back to the **Azure Portal** > search for **"Log Analytics WorkSpace"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

We'll click **"Create log analytics workspace"** and input the following details:
- Resource group: ```RG-Cyber-Lab```
- Name: ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01``` ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è it has to be globally unique
- Region: ```East US 2``` ‚ûú put it in the **Same Region** as the other resources from our environment

We can then just click **"Review + Create"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ Our **Log Analytics Workspace** is now created.

<br>

Go back to the Azure Portal > search for **"Microsoft Sentinel"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Click **"Create Microsoft Sentinel"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

This next step is when we Add the Log Analytics Workspace we just made to our Microsoft Sentinel instance:

- We'll click on our **Workspace** > and click **"Add"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ We just made the connection between the **Microsoft Sentinel** and the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

<br>

> 
> The Watchlist is going to be comprised of that Geo Data from the file we downloaded earlier.
>
> Then later we'll use the Geo Data to Plot Attacker's IP Addresses on a Map.

<br>

First we'll through the Azure Portal to **Microsoft Sentinel** > and click on our Sentinel Instance connected to the LAW: ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Then we'll go to **"Watchlists"** on the left ‚ûú and we're going to **Create a New Watchlist**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Now for the Geo IP Watchlist we'll use this details:
- **General Tab**:
  - Name & Alias: ```geoip```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

- **Source Tab**:
  - Source type: ```Local file```
  - File type: ```CSV file with a header (.csv)```
  - Number of lines before row with headings: ```0```
  - Upload file ‚ûú We're going to browse for the file that we downloaded to our Desktop earlier:
    - ```geoip-summarized.csv```

<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è You should be able to see a "valid-looking preview" of the Geo IP File on the right

<br>

- Still inside the **Source Tab**:
  - Search Key: ```network```

üí° The ***Search Key Column*** is what we're going to use to match the Attacker's IP Addresses to different Network Blocks.

<br>

Click **"Review + Create"** to **Create the ```geoip``` Watchlist**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

This should take a while:

- Allow time for these files to ‚Äúupload‚Äù from your computer into Sentinel / Log Analytics Workspace.

‚ö†Ô∏è There are about 27k rows/records












![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a2c962-8229-4fa1-89df-d7a9264e9e45)

Now inside the **attack-vm** > open **Remote Desktop Connection** > Paste the **Public IP Address of the Windows VM** and connect

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1790beb-344f-4d2d-af49-9a6f30f282f8)

For the **Credentials** ‚ûú use some random made up **Username & Password** ‚ûú username ```josh``` for example

Since this user does not exist in the Windows VM ‚ûú the **Log In will Fail**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba4a924d-eb07-474c-8020-21e4ce0ad6d7)

Repeat the **Failed Log In** 2 more times with the same **Wrong Username & Password**

<br>

‚úÖ So 3 Logs have been Generated on the Windows VM ‚ûú which we will analyse later

<br>

Now we're going to open **SSMS**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8be34c69-6216-4aa7-b2f3-d633f2d82c2b)

Then we'll copy the **IP Address of the Windows VM** ‚ûú which has the **SQL Server**

- in Server Name: we'll Paste the **IP Address**
- Authentication: **SQL Server Authentication**
- then our Real **Username** is ```sa``` & **Password** is ```Cyberlab123!```

  - but we're going to login with a user that doesn't exist ‚ûú so we can **Generate Failed Logs**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb1c19c-5959-4764-a183-c74a9e5d6e76)

We'll **Attemp and Fail** to Login 2 more times to **Generate a total of 3 Failed Logins**

Then we'll "Login For Real" with the correct **Username** & **Password** just to show that we can Login from **Australia (Attack VM)**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f70930a6-50b1-49f5-8fad-7b56571eaed1)

We can then disconnect from the Server:

<br>

Going back to the **Azure Portal** > Go to **Virtual machines** > Open the ```linux-vm``` > copy its **Public IP Address** 

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf625627-4567-452b-b13e-d07a8f4cb4b9)

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4668916b-869d-4065-8274-99063e0625ba)

Then inside the Attack VM ‚ûú we'll open **Powershell**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8426567a-374f-42f1-b2bf-bf01ad2c2f9e)

Now we can **SSH** ‚ûú use a **Fake Username** ```josh``` ‚ûú this Username doesn't exist on the **Linux VM**

So we'll type: ```ssh "FAKE USERNAME"@"DESTINATION (which is the Linux VM)"```  ‚ûú press "Enter" to attempt to connect:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fb6f2d1-c152-43e3-b771-f1bc10716e71)

Type **"yes"** to Accept the Certificate:

  ![VM create](hhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf5dc7e4-245f-4864-b849-5105d1fa1b4d)

Then it'll ask us to **Enter our Password**

This **User doesn't even exist**: so whatever Password we put ‚ûú it's going to **Fail to Login & Create a Log**.

Basically we're attempting to **Brute-Force into the Linux VM**  ‚ûú do it 3 times to **Generate 3 Failed Logins**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab202f7-a7a0-4007-a1ae-df4dc01e9097)

Then we can actually Shut Down our **Attack VM** ‚ûú we won't be using it anymore for this Lab ‚ûú and go back to our own Computer

> 
> We'll do the same thing with the **Linux VM** after ‚ûú look at the **Logs we Generated** by attempting to Log into it

<br>

Inside our **Windows Vm** > Copy the **Public IP Address**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

Open **Remote Desktop** > connect to the **Windows VM**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

Then open **Event Viewer**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

Again, this is where the logs are ‚ûú First we're going to check out the **"Security"** ones.

These are the logs for when someone attempts to **Connect with Remote Desktop** or even try to **Map a Remote File Share**.

Event ```4625``` is the **Failed Logon Event** ‚ûú and we can see a whole bunch of them here:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

We didn't generate most of these.

If we **"Filter Current Log"** > and type ```4625``` just to see the **Failed Logons** ‚ûú it'll show us only the **Failed Logons**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

We can see the the **"Account Name"** is different for each Event ‚ûú and these are **actual bad actors or bots** on the Internet.

These are not our **Intentional Failed Logons** ‚ûú these are other randon entities trying to **Logon to our VM**, since it's been on for the previous 10 hours.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

If we scroll down we can actually find **Our Own Failed Logon** with the **Username** ```josh```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6922b5a7-bf0e-46b9-ac0b-b79be1074f97)

‚ö†Ô∏è Aside from our 3 **Intentionally Generated Failed Logs**:
- We can see that there were almost **2000 different Attempts to Break Into our Windows VM**:

To **Attempt to Connect to the Linux VM** ‚ûú we first need the get the **IP Address of the Linux VM**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

From our Computer:
- if you're using a **Mac** ‚ûú **open Terminal**
- if you're using **Windows** ‚ûú **open Powershell**

And type in the following:

```commandline
ssh labuser@PUBLIC IP ADDRESS OF THE LINUX VM
```
<br>

Press **"Enter"** > then type the **Password**: ```Cyberlab123!``` > then press **"Enter"** again

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

We are now Logged Into the **Linux VM**

To see the **Logs** we can type in the following **Linux Command**:

```commandline
cd /var/log
```
<br>

‚òùÔ∏è This will basically change our Directory to the **Log's Directory**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

And then we can type ```cat auth.log | grep password``` to pull out all the "lines" that have the word **"Password"** in it:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

We can see a whole bunch of **Failed Password for Invalid User** Events:
- Meaning ‚ûú some entities were trying to **Login to our Linux VM** from **Random IP Addresses** using **Wrong Credentials**.

We can also see our **Successful Logins** using the **Username** ```labuser```:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd16cae4-cdfd-45c8-b0a3-d94a04c9677d)

If we filter through:
- ```Accepted``` ‚ûú  we can see that only we were able to **Successfully Login**:

```commandline
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep Accepted
```
<br>

- ```josh``` ‚ûú  we can see all the **Unsuccessful Login Attempts** with the Username "josh":

```commandline
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep josh
```
<br>

# Conclusion


We have to keep in mind hat if we have, let's say, 1000 computers in our Environment ‚ûú  it would be too laborious to just login into each one of them, and analyse the each log indivudually this way.

That's why we are going to **Automatically Ingest all the Logs into a Central Repository**.

We'll Set Up Queries to Automatically look through the Logs and Alert us on certain Events.

This is the end of our **Logging and Monitoring Lab**, and in the next phases we're going to Inspect Logs, Create Incidents & Respond to those Incidents.
