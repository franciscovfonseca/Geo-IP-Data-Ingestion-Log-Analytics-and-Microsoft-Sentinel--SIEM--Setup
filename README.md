<h1 align="center">Log Analytics Workspace & Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) Setup</h1>

<br />

In this lab we'll set up **Log Analytics Workspace** as our **Central Log Repository****, as well as **Microsoft Sentinel** as our **SIEM**.

Basically we're going to create what we call a **"Watchlist"** inside of our **SIEM** (Microsoft Sentinel).

This Watchlist is going to essentially be a long list of **Network Blocks**, with the corresponding *Longitude*, *Latitude*, *City Name* and *Country Name*.

And basically we'll use this to derive **Geo-location from Attacker's IP Addresses**.

So when somebody **Attacks our Network**, or for example they fail to login to our Virtual Machine, we'll be able to:
1. Inspect that Log
2. Match the Log to a given Network Block
3. and Plot it on the World Map

This way we'll be able to clearly see **Where the Attacks are Coming From**, according to their **Geo-Location**.

<br>

The first thing we're going to do is **[Download this Geo-Data CSV file](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/blob/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON)/geoip-summarized.csv 
)** onto our Desktop.

It will open up a new tab, and you can **Download the Raw File**:

<br>

> Then we're going to **Create a Log Analytics WorkSpace** ‚ûú our **Central Log Repository**
> 
> This will be our **Centralized Repository** for **Collecting, Storing & Analyzing Log Data** from various **Azure Resources and Services**.

<br>

We'll go back to the **Azure Portal** > search for **"Log Analytics WorkSpace"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

We'll click **"Create log analytics workspace"** and input the following details:
- Resource group: ```RG-Cyber-Lab```
- Name: ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01``` ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è it has to be globally unique
- Region: ```East US 2``` ‚ûú put it in the **Same Region** as the other resources from our environment

We can then just click **"Review + Create"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ Our **Log Analytics Workspace** is now created.

<br>

Go back to the Azure Portal > search for **"Microsoft Sentinel"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Click **"Create Microsoft Sentinel"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

This next step is when we Add the Log Analytics Workspace we just made to our Microsoft Sentinel instance:

- We'll click on our **Workspace** > and click **"Add"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ We just made the connection between the **Microsoft Sentinel** and the **Log Analytics Workspace**.

<summary> <h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Geo IP Watchlist</h2> </summary>
<br>

> Once Sentinel is setup ‚ûú we'll go into Sentinel and we're going to create what's called a Watchlist.
> 
> The Watchlist is going to be comprised of that Geo Data from the file we downloaded earlier.
>
> Then later we'll use the Geo Data to Plot Attacker's IP Addresses on a Map.

<br>

First we'll through the Azure Portal to **Microsoft Sentinel** > and click on our Sentinel Instance connected to the LAW: ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Then we'll go to **"Watchlists"** on the left ‚ûú and we're going to **Create a New Watchlist**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Now for the Geo IP Watchlist we'll use this details:
- **General Tab**:
  - Name & Alias: ```geoip```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

- **Source Tab**:
  - Source type: ```Local file```
  - File type: ```CSV file with a header (.csv)```
  - Number of lines before row with headings: ```0```
  - Upload file ‚ûú We're going to browse for the file that we downloaded to our Desktop earlier:
    - ```geoip-summarized.csv```

<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è You should be able to see a "valid-looking preview" of the Geo IP File on the right

<br>

- Still inside the **Source Tab**:
  - Search Key: ```network```

üí° The ***Search Key Column*** is what we're going to use to match the Attacker's IP Addresses to different Network Blocks.

<br>

Click **"Review + Create"** to **Create the ```geoip``` Watchlist**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

This should take a while:

- Allow time for these files to ‚Äúupload‚Äù from your computer into Sentinel / Log Analytics Workspace.

‚ö†Ô∏è There are about 26k rows/records

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

<h2></h2>

<br>

While the Geo IP CSV File is being "uploaded", we can actually start quering the Watchlist inside of Log Analytics.

Copy this syntax : ```_GetWatchlist("geoip")```

We'll open the **Log Analytics Workspace** we just created ‚ûú our Central Log Repository:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

And now we'll see some of the records inside ‚ûú click on "Logs"

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí° Note</summary>**
> 
> There's not really anything in here yet ‚ûú because we haven't sent anything here yet.
> 
> But when we ingest the Watchlist into Sentinel ‚ûú Sentinel makes use of the LAW and stores the Watchlist in there.
> 
> And just to clarify: ```_GetWatchlist("geoip")``` is the syntax we use to query the Watchlist
> 
>   </details>

<br>

Now if we run the Query ‚ûú once it starts ingesting ‚ûú a few records should come out here:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ So we were able to Query it and see a few  different records inside

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

So after waiting a bit  ‚ûú if we go back to the **Watchlist** ‚ûú we can see that all the 26k records were successfully uploaded as **Watchlist Items** ‚úÖ

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

Now go back to **Log Analytics Workspace** > go to **"Logs"** again > and **Run this Query**:

```commandline
_GetWatchlist("geoip")
| count
```
<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032bf0f-95dd-4edd-a1a2-c714da69ba61)

‚úÖ We can see 26k+ records were "counted" as being part of the Watchlist

# Conclusion







We have to keep in mind hat if we have, let's say, 1000 computers in our Environment ‚ûú  it would be too laborious to just login into each one of them, and analyse the each log indivudually this way.

That's why we are going to **Automatically Ingest all the Logs into a Central Repository**.

We'll Set Up Queries to Automatically look through the Logs and Alert us on certain Events.

This is the end of our **Logging and Monitoring Lab**, and in the next phases we're going to Inspect Logs, Create Incidents & Respond to those Incidents.
